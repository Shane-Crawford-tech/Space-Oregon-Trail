Encounters:

E1: "Your colony approaches an asteroid field. The only way to get to your destination on time is to go through. Alternatively, you could change route and go around. What do you choose?"
  1.) [Chance] Decide to go through anyways (between none and moderate damage)
  2.) [Exit] Decide to go a different route
  3.) [Item/Weaponry] Fire away at the asteroids to clear a path
  4.) [Item/Weaponry] Overcharge the reactor, giving the ship enough power to get through quickly and unscathed


E2: "As you do yearly, your colony hosts the anneversary of the Space Warlord's death. This time, however, it seems the colony wants to have a massive feast. Will you keep the celebration modest, or go all out?"
  1.) [+?# of colonists, - supplies] Allow a feast to be had! The more food the merrier, as they say.
  2.) [- morale] Keep things modest. You will all need to keep supplies for the journey ahead.


E3: "As your ship charts its course, you come across an abandoned fleet of vessels which don't appear to have been picked clean. Valuable loot could be found here."
  1.) [Chance] Choose to explore the vessels.
      - 60% chance of more materials
      - 30% chance of a battle with diseased crew remnants
      - 5% chance of your crew catching disease (must be cured or colony will succumb)
      - 5% chance of finding a rare/valuable item
  2.) [Exit] Continue past the fleet. Not worth risking your lives for.
  3.) [Ship Upgrade] Using your acquired long range radio, you radio the nearest fleet to inform them of the wreckage.
      - Recieve gold/supplies in payment for the information


E4: [Dependant on having Ship Radio or not] "Your colony comes across a group of bandit ships on its travels. They radio over, 'Give us all of your valuables and gold, or we will destroy that puny ship of yours-'. What is your response?"
  1.) [Choice] You conceide, allowing the bandits to dock aboard the ship to get whatever they want. They don't hurt anyone, but you are now mostly broke and resourceless.
  2.) [Choice] You attempt to persuade the bandits to let you go.
      - With bigger colony: "After all, your colony could take them on any time of the year."
      - With smaller: "After all, picking on small fry like you would be more a waste of time, yes?"
  3.) [Battle!] No one attempts to attack your colony without punishment. To your stations!
  4.) [Item/Weaponry] Your obvious firepower makes you wonder why they even attempted this.
      - Intimidation attempt
  5.) [Question] Uhm....who are you, exactly?
